#devcha

devCha is a project that i decided to work on to learn the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node)

Using node it pulls games from the riot dev challenge endpoint, giving us the match id's of urf games
It get's statistics from the urf games using the Riot API match v2.2 and sums up champion wins and losses and stores them in mongo db
